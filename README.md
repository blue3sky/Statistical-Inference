# Statistical-Inference
This repository contains the lab assignments for the facilitation of John Hopkins University' Coursera MOOC on Statistical Inference. The facilitation was conducted in collaboration with the Singapore InfoComm Development Authority in Jan 2015. I hope the lab assignments are helpful in helping users learn and understand about hypothesis testing, t-tests, and ANOVA.

Slides for Week 1 & Week 2 (probability and distribution) are available here: http://www.slideshare.net/eugeneyan/statistical-inference-probability-and-distribution

Slides for Week 3 (hypothesis testing and t tests) are available here: to be updated

Slides for Week 4 (ANOVA and corrections) are available here: to be updated
